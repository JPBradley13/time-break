# time-break
Welcome to Time Break: an original PvP local co-op shooter! Use an arsenal of unique abilities, weapons and items as well as the environment itself to defeat your opponent.

This project is written in Java, and makes use of the JSFML library to support multimedia. It was initially conceptualised and created as a group academic project during my second year of the Lancaster University MSci Computer Science course.

To win, you must be the first player to reduce your opponentâ€™s health bar to 0, 3 times. To do this, you have an arsenal of weapons, items, character abilities and the environment itself at your disposal.

Please read the manual for gameplay controls and information on individual gameplay elements.
